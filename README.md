# Hi, I’m Azhar 👋

I'm an aspiring Data Analyst executing data-driven solution to increase efficiency, accuracy, and utility of internal data processing. I am looking for the opportunity to build a challenging career and apply my skills in an innovative and simplify process. I enjoy working in a team and communicating data-driven results.

Previously, I worked as a Marketing Manager for 3 years in Digital Marketing field. After some mind changes and decisions, I transisted into Data Science Filed looking into the Scope and Opportunities. I know Graphic Desiginig as well.
